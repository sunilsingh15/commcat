<div class="mt-5 w-9/10 md:w-4/5 text-center md:text-left">
  <p>Community cats are cats that reside in public spaces across Singapore. Cats are very territorial and generally roam within a fixed neighbourhood, especially when they are cared for by volunteer feeders!</p>
  <p class="mt-5">An easy way to identify a community cat is to check if its left ear has been tipped. This signifies that the cat has been sterilised, most likely as part of the <a href="https://catwelfare.org/sterilisation-overview">'Trap-Neuter-Return-Manage' Programme</a>.</p>

<h1 class="text-2xl mt-7 text-[#7f0019]">Are they friendly?</h1>

<div class="mt-5 w-9/10 md:w-4/5 text-center md:text-left">
  <p>It's tough to say!</p>
  <p class="mt-5">All cats have different personalities, which include how friendly they are towards humans. If you wish to befriend a cat, we recommend you let them approach and sniff you first.</p>
  <p class="mt-5">If they show signs of fear or aggression, like running away, hissing or hiding, you should give them their space and leave them alone.</p>
